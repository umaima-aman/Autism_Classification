**Tweet_Sentiment_Classification_DeepLearning**

This projrct aims to  perform sentiment analysis on financial news-related tweets using the DistilBERT model. The goal is to classify tweets into one of three sentiment labels: "Bearish", "Bullish", or "Neutral". 

**Dataset**

The dataset code consists of annotated finance-related tweets with sentiment labels. The dataset is divided into training and validation subsets. The code will tokenize the tweet texts, train a DistilBERT-based sentiment classifier, and evaluate its performance.
We use Hugging Face Trainer for Training/Inference Loops.
